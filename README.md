## Text Emotion Classification
### Overview
This project focuses on classifying emotions from text inputs using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify and label the emotion expressed in a given sentence or piece of text.

### Features
Preprocessing of text data (e.g., tokenization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization)
Training and evaluation of various machine learning models for emotion classification
Utilization of deep learning techniques for enhanced accuracy
Visualization of results and performance metrics

### Datasets
The dataset used in this project is the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp

### Models
The Sequential model from keras.models was used to build the Classifier.

### Future Work
Improving model accuracy with advanced NLP techniques
Expanding the dataset with more diverse and extensive samples
Deploying the model as a web application for real-time emotion detection
